Drawing Bézier Curves
=====================

This is a companion repo for my [blog post on drawing Bézier curves](http://ciechanowski.me/blog/2014/02/18/drawing_bezier_curves/). The Xcode project contains the complete line drawing engine powering [Revolved](http://revolvedapp.com) – my 3D modeling tool for the iPad.

While the app build by the project is quite simple, the underlying concepts are (hopefully) not trivial. Moreover, the entire rendering system is OpenGL ES 2.0 based so this project can serve as quick startup point for other, more complicated OpenGL based apps.

##Requirements

- iOS 7.0 (should work on previous versions as well, but I haven't tested it)
